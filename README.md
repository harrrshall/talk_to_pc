# Socket Programming Project: Real-Time Communication App

## Prerequisites
- Linux operating system
- JavaScript knowledge
- Understanding of socket programming concepts

## Installation and Setup (For Linux Users)

### Step 1: Edit IP Address
In the socket.js or sockets.py file, locate the last line where the IP address is specified. Edit the IP address to match the IP address of your server machine.

### Step 2: Open Port
Open the port on your server machine to allow incoming connections. For Linux Ubuntu users, you can use the following command to open a port (replace `<port_number>` with the desired port number):

sudo ufw allow <port_number>

### Step 3: Download the App
Download and install the TCP/UDP Server-Client application from the [App Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tcpudpserverclient.steffenrvs.tcpudpserverclient) in your mobile phone

### Step 4: Create Client
Create a client instance on your phone and a server instance on your PC. Ensure that the client is configured to connect to the IP address and port where the server is running.

## Usage
Once the server is running and the client is connected, users can start communicating with each other in real-time through the application.

## Note
Ensure that both the server and client devices are connected to the same network for communication to work properly.
